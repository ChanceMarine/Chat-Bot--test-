# Rule Improvement Tasks

This file tracks errors encountered and rule improvements needed to prevent them in the future. Each item should be checked off when the corresponding rule is created or updated.

## Current Tasks

### 🔴 High Priority

- [ ] **Kiro Methodology Enforcement**
  - **Error**: AI jumped straight to implementation instead of following three-phase approach
  - **Suggested Fix**: Ensure kiro-master-guide.mdc is properly loaded and applied at start of conversations
  - **Status**: 🔄 In Progress

- [ ] **File Permission Enforcement**
  - **Error**: AI created files without asking permission
  - **Suggested Fix**: Strengthen ai-prompting-strategies.mdc to ensure permission asking
  - **Status**: 🔄 In Progress

### 🟡 Medium Priority

- [ ] **Rule Loading Verification**
  - **Error**: Rules with alwaysApply: true not being applied consistently
  - **Suggested Fix**: Add verification step to ensure all alwaysApply rules are loaded
  - **Status**: ⏳ Pending

### 🟢 Low Priority

- [ ] **Template Standardization**
  - **Error**: Inconsistent rule file structure
  - **Suggested Fix**: Create standardized templates for different rule types
  - **Status**: ⏳ Pending

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Recently Completed

- [x] **Missing cursor-rules.mdc**
  - **Error**: File referenced but didn't exist
  - **Fix Applied**: Renamed cursor-rules-generation.mdc to cursor-rules.mdc
  - **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Error Tracking Format

When adding new tasks, use this format:

```markdown
- [ ] **Task Title**
  - **Error**: Brief description of what went wrong
  - **Suggested Fix**: What rule or change would prevent this
  - **Status**: ⏳ Pending / 🔄 In Progress / ✅ Completed
```

## Rule Improvement Process

1. **Identify Error**: When something goes wrong, document it here
2. **Analyze Root Cause**: Determine what rule could prevent it
3. **Create Task**: Add to appropriate priority section
4. **Implement Fix**: Create or update the relevant rule
5. **Mark Complete**: Check off when rule is implemented
6. **Archive**: Move completed tasks to "Completed Tasks" section

## Priority Levels

- **🔴 High Priority**: Errors that break core functionality or methodology
- **🟡 Medium Priority**: Errors that affect quality or consistency
- **🟢 Low Priority**: Improvements for better organization or efficiency

## Integration with Self-Improvement System

This file works with the self-improvement-system.mdc to:
- Track emerging patterns that need rules
- Document repeated errors for prevention
- Maintain a backlog of rule improvements
- Ensure systematic rule evolution

## Maintenance

- Review this file weekly
- Archive completed tasks monthly
- Update priorities based on error frequency
- Cross-reference with other rule files for consistency
