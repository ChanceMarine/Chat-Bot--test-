## Proposed Consolidation Plan

### New Structure (8 Files)

1. **kiro-methodology.mdc** 
   - Sources: kiro-master-guide.mdc, task-execution-guide.mdc, kiro-communication-style.mdc
   - Purpose: Complete Kiro taskmaster methodology and communication

   - Sources: ai-prompting-strategies.mdc, ai-decision-frameworks.mdc
   - Purpose: AI interaction patterns and decision frameworks

3. **development-standards.mdc**
   - Sources: quality-assurance-framework.mdc, performance-standards.mdc, security-standards.mdc, tech-stack-standards.mdc
   - Purpose: Code quality, performance, security, and technology standards

4. **testing-practices.mdc**
   - Sources: testing-standards.mdc, quality-assurance-framework.mdc (testing sections)
   - Purpose: Comprehensive testing guidance

5. **project-organization.mdc**

## Content Preservation Strategy

### Critical Content to Preserve
- All unique code examples and best practices
- Specific configuration templates
- Security guidelines and patterns
- Performance optimization techniques
- Complete Kiro methodology workflow

### Content to Eliminate
- Duplicate examples across files
- Redundant explanations of same concepts
- Outdated or conflicting guidance
- Verbose introductions that repeat

### Content to Merge
- Similar best practices from different files
- Related configuration examples
- Complementary guidance on same topics

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Methodology (High Impact)
- Create kiro-methodology.mdc
- Consolidate AI collaboration guidance
- Establish communication standards

### Phase 2: Development Standards (Medium Impact)  
- Merge code quality standards
- Consolidate testing practices
- Unify security and performance guidance

### Phase 3: Organization and Process (Lower Impact)
- Merge project organization files
- Consolidate workflow guidance
- Create rule management system

## Metrics

### Before Optimization
- **18 files** with 25,456 total lines
- **Estimated 45% redundancy** (11,455 redundant lines)
- **Multiple sources** for same information
- **Inconsistent formatting** and organization

### After Optimization (Projected)
- **8 files** with 18,000 total lines  
- **<10% redundancy** (minimal overlap)
- **Single source** for each topic
- **Consistent formatting** and organization

### Improvement Metrics
- **56% reduction** in file count
- **29% reduction** in total content
- **78% reduction** in redundancy
- **100% improvement** in organization consistency

This analysis provides the foundation for systematic consolidation that will significantly improve the usability and effectiveness of the Cursor rules system.
