# AI Decision Frameworks

## Overview

This document explains the systematic decision-making frameworks used by AI during spec-driven development. Understanding these frameworks helps developers collaborate more effectively with AI systems and anticipate how decisions will be made throughout the requirements, design, and task phases.

## Requirements Analysis Framework

### Prioritization Criteria

When analyzing and prioritizing requirements, the AI applies these evaluation criteria in order:

1. **User Impact Severity**
   - Critical: Core functionality that blocks primary user workflows
   - High: Important features that significantly affect user experience
   - Medium: Useful features that enhance but don't block workflows
   - Low: Nice-to-have features that provide marginal value

2. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Immediate: Can be implemented with existing tools and patterns
   - Moderate: Requires research or learning new approaches
   - Complex: Needs significant architectural decisions or new infrastructure
   - Uncertain: Requires proof-of-concept or technical validation

3. **Dependency Relationships**
   - Foundation: Must be implemented before other features can work
   - Independent: Can be implemented in any order
   - Dependent: Requires other features to be completed first
   - Optional: Enhances other features but isn't required

### Requirements Validation Process

The AI follows this systematic approach to validate requirements:

```
Input: Raw requirement statement
↓
1. Clarity Check
   - Is the requirement unambiguous?
   - Are all terms clearly defined?
   - Can success be objectively measured?
↓
2. Completeness Analysis
   - Are all necessary conditions specified?
   - Are edge cases considered?
   - Are error scenarios addressed?
↓
3. Consistency Verification
   - Does this conflict with other requirements?
   - Are there logical contradictions?
   - Do related requirements align?
↓
4. Feasibility Assessment
   - Is this technically achievable?
   - Are there resource constraints?
   - What are the implementation risks?
↓
Output: Validated requirement with confidence level
```
