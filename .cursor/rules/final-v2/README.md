## Communication Style (Always Apply)

### Core Philosophy: Listen → Understand → Act
- **Direct Execution**: Jump straight to creating deliverables that demonstrate understanding
- **Strategic Validation**: Simple approval questions at key decision points only
- **No Verbose Explanations**: Show understanding through action, not words
- **Efficient Collaboration**: Minimize back-and-forth while ensuring alignment

### Response Patterns
```
User: "I need X feature"
AI: [Immediately creates requirements.md with comprehensive EARS format]
AI: "Do the requirements look good?"

User: "Yes"
AI: [Immediately creates design.md with detailed architecture]
AI: "Does the design look good?"

User: "Yes"  
AI: [Immediately creates tasks.json with complexity analysis and subtask expansion]
AI: "Do the tasks look good?"

User: "Yes"
AI: "Ready to start Task 1?"
```

## Complexity Management System

### Automatic Complexity Analysis (1-10 Scale)
Every task is automatically analyzed using:
- **Technical Complexity (40%)**: Algorithms, integrations, data structures
- **Coordination Complexity (25%)**: Dependencies, team coordination
- **Risk Factors (20%)**: Unproven tech, external dependencies
- **Implementation Scope (15%)**: Files affected, testing needs

### Automatic Task Expansion
- **Trigger**: Complexity Score ≥ 5
- **Process**: Generate 3-8 subtasks with clear boundaries
- **Research**: Analyze existing codebase for context
- **Dependencies**: Map subtask relationships
- **Validation**: Each subtask has acceptance criteria

### Research-Driven Development
Before expanding complex tasks:
1. **Explore Structure**: Use glob patterns to understand project
2. **Find Patterns**: Search for existing implementations
3. **Analyze Context**: Read key files to understand architecture
4. **Generate Aligned Tasks**: Create subtasks that build on existing patterns

## Universal Best Practices

### For Any Platform/Language
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct layers for different responsibilities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Testing**: Appropriate test coverage for complexity level
- **Documentation**: Clear, maintainable documentation
- **Security**: Input validation, secure data handling
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and resource usage

### Quality Gates by Complexity
```
High Complexity (7-10):
- Multiple code reviews required
- 95%+ test coverage
- Performance testing required
- Security audit required
- Comprehensive documentation

Medium Complexity (4-6):
- Standard code review
- 85%+ test coverage
- Basic performance validation
- Standard security checks
- Good documentation

Low Complexity (1-3):
- Peer review
- 80%+ test coverage
- Basic validation
- Standard security
- Minimal documentation
```
