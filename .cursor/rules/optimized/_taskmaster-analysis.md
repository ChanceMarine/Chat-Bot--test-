# Claude Taskmaster Deep Dive Analysis

## Core Complexity Analysis System

### Complexity Scoring (1-10 Scale)
Claude Taskmaster uses a sophisticated 1-10 complexity scoring system:

- **1-3 (Low)**: Simple, straightforward tasks with minimal dependencies
- **4-6 (Medium)**: Moderate complexity with some integration or coordination needed
- **7-8 (High)**: Complex tasks requiring multiple subsystems or advanced logic
- **9-10 (Critical)**: Extremely complex tasks with high risk and multiple integration points

### Complexity Analysis Criteria
The system evaluates tasks based on:

1. **Technical Complexity**
   - Algorithm sophistication required
   - Number of integration points
   - Data structure complexity
   - Performance requirements

2. **Coordination Complexity**
   - Dependencies on other systems
   - Team coordination requirements
   - Cross-functional integration needs
   - API integration complexity

3. **Risk Factors**
   - Unproven technologies
   - External dependencies
   - Security implications
   - Performance constraints

4. **Implementation Scope**
   - Number of files/components affected
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation needs
   - Configuration complexity

## Task Expansion System

### Expansion Triggers
Tasks are automatically flagged for expansion when:
- **Complexity Score ≥ 5** (configurable threshold)
- **Multiple integration points** identified
- **High risk factors** present
- **Broad implementation scope** detected

### Expansion Strategies

#### 1. Complexity-Report Strategy
Used when a complexity analysis has been performed:
```json
{
  "taskId": 24,
  "taskTitle": "Implement AI-Powered Test Generation Command",
  "complexityScore": 8,
  "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
  "expansionPrompt": "Expand task 24 into 6 subtasks, focusing on: 1) Command structure implementation, 2) AI prompt engineering, 3) Test file generation, 4) Framework-specific templates, 5) MCP tool integration, 6) Documentation integration",
  "reasoning": "High complexity due to AI integration, multiple frameworks, file operations, and configuration requirements"
}
```

#### 2. Research Strategy
Used when research mode is enabled:
- Analyzes current codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools
- Identifies existing implementations and patterns
- Generates tasks that build upon existing architecture
- Ensures alignment with current technology stack

#### 3. Default Strategy
Standard fallback for general task expansion:
- Breaks down based on logical component boundaries
- Considers dependencies and sequencing
- Maintains clear interfaces between subtasks

### Subtask Generation Logic

#### Subtask Structure
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Specific subtask name",
  "description": "Detailed description of what needs to be done",
  "completed": false,
  "dependencies": ["parent_task_id"],
  "estimatedEffort": "2-4 hours",
  "acceptanceCriteria": "Clear validation criteria"
}
```

#### Expansion Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each subtask focuses on one specific component
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between subtasks
3. **Testable Units**: Each subtask can be independently validated
4. **Logical Sequencing**: Dependencies and order are clearly defined
5. **Appropriate Granularity**: Not too broad, not too narrow

## Integration with AI Providers

### Multi-Provider Analysis
- **Claude 3.5**: Primary analysis engine for complex reasoning
- **Perplexity**: Research and current best practices
- **GPT-4**: Alternative analysis for comparison
- **Gemini**: Specialized for certain technical domains

### Research Integration
When research mode is enabled:
```javascript
// Codebase analysis before task expansion
1. Use Glob tool to explore project structure
2. Use Grep tool to search for existing implementations
3. Use Read tool to examine key files
4. Generate context-aware subtasks
```

## Complexity Analysis Output

### Analysis Report Structure
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "totalTasks": 93,
    "analysisCount": 10,
    "thresholdScore": 5,
    "projectName": "Project Name",
    "usedResearch": true
  },
  "complexTasks": [
    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Task Name",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detailed expansion guidance",
      "reasoning": "Why this task is complex and needs expansion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Expansion Recommendations
For each complex task (score ≥ threshold):
- **Recommended Subtask Count**: Based on complexity analysis
- **Expansion Prompt**: Specific guidance for breaking down the task
- **Reasoning**: Explanation of complexity factors
- **Implementation Strategy**: Suggested approach for subtask creation
