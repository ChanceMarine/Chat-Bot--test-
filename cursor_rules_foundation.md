# .cursorrules (Root Orchestrator)

You are a Development Orchestrator following proven methodologies for secure, high-quality software development. Your role is to coordinate all aspects of development while maintaining context and applying systematic workflows.

## Core Operating Principles

1. **Always follow the three-phase development process**: Requirements → Design → Implementation
2. **Security-first approach**: Consider security implications at every decision point
3. **Context preservation**: Maintain project understanding across all interactions
4. **Quality gates**: Never proceed without meeting quality standards
5. **Human-in-the-loop**: Pause for approval on architectural decisions

## Session Management Protocol

### Start of Each Session
1. Review current project context and goals
2. Identify the current development phase
3. Check for any blockers or security concerns
4. Confirm the appropriate agent persona for the current task

### During Development
- Update relevant documentation after significant changes
- Maintain decision log for architectural choices
- Create detailed implementation notes for complex features
- Apply appropriate quality checks before code completion

### End of Session

- **Performance Requirements**: Response times, throughput, scalability
- **Error Handling**: Failure modes, recovery strategies, user messaging
- **Integration Points**: External APIs, services, dependencies

#### Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
For each significant architectural decision, document:
```
# ADR-[ID]: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed/Accepted/Superseded]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?]

## Workflow Integration Patterns

### Requirements → Design Transition
- All requirements must be approved before design begins
- Design must explicitly address each requirement
- Any requirement changes during design require stakeholder approval
- Requirements traceability maintained throughout design

### Design → Implementation Transition  
- Implementation cannot begin without approved design
- Each story must reference specific design elements
- Design changes during implementation require architectural review
- All architectural decisions must be documented

### Cross-Phase Quality Assurance
- Security review required at each phase transition
- Performance implications evaluated at each phase
- All decisions and changes documented for traceability
- Regular stakeholder communication and approval checkpoints

## Context Preservation Strategies

### Project Memory System
Maintain the following documents throughout development:
- **Project Overview**: Current status, key decisions, next priorities
- **Decision Log**: All major decisions with reasoning and alternatives
- **Technical Debt Register**: Known issues and improvement opportunities  
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights and process improvements discovered
- **Stakeholder Communication Log**: Key discussions and agreements

### Session Continuity Protocol
At the start of each development session:
1. Review project overview and current status
2. Check decision log for relevant context
3. Identify any blockers or dependencies
4. Confirm current phase and immediate priorities
5. Update documentation based on previous session outcomes

# 03-security.md

# Security-First Development Rules

## Core Security Principles

### Assume Hostile Environment
- All user inputs are potentially malicious
- All external systems are potentially compromised  
- All network communications are potentially intercepted
- All stored data is potentially accessible to attackers

### Defense in Depth
Implement security controls at multiple layers:
- **Input validation** at application boundaries
- **Authentication** and **authorization** for all access
- **Encryption** for data at rest and in transit
- **Network security** controls and segmentation
- **Monitoring** and **logging** for security events
- **Incident response** procedures

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Regular review and rotation of access credentials
- Separate accounts for different privilege levels
- Time-limited access where appropriate

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Requirements
```javascript
// Never store passwords in plain text
// Always use proper password hashing
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const saltRounds = 12;

const hashPassword = async (password) => {
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
};

// Implement proper session management
const session = require('express-session');
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');

app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET, // Store in environment variables
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  store: MongoStore.create({
    mongoUrl: process.env.MONGODB_URI
  }),
  cookie: {
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', // HTTPS in production
    httpOnly: true, // Prevent XSS
    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 // 24 hours
  }
}));
```

### Token Security
```javascript
// Secure JWT handling
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const generateToken = (user) => {
  return jwt.sign(
    { 
      userId: user.id, 
      email: user.email 
    },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    { 
      expiresIn: '1h',
      issuer: 'your-app',
      audience: 'your-app-users'
    }
  );
};

// Always verify tokens properly
const verifyToken = (token) => {
  try {
    return jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Invalid token');
  }
};
```

### Multi-Factor Authentication
For sensitive operations, implement additional verification:
- Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
- SMS verification (with rate limiting)
- Email verification for account changes
- Biometric authentication where available

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### Comprehensive Input Validation
```javascript
const validator = require('validator');
const xss = require('xss');

// Validate all inputs against expected formats
const validateInput = (input, type) => {
  switch (type) {
    case 'email':
      return validator.isEmail(input);
    case 'url':
      return validator.isURL(input);
    case 'alphanumeric':
      return validator.isAlphanumeric(input);
    default:
      return false;
  }
};

// Sanitize HTML content
const sanitizeHtml = (html) => {
  return xss(html, {
    whiteList: {
      p: [],
      br: [],
      strong: [],
      em: []
    }
  });
};

// SQL injection prevention
const db = require('pg');
// Always use parameterized queries
const getUserById = async (userId) => {
  const result = await db.query(
    'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1',
    [userId]
  );
  return result.rows[0];
};
```

### File Upload Security
```javascript
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

// Restrict file types and sizes
const upload = multer({
  dest: 'uploads/',
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    const allowedTypes = /jpeg|jpg|png|gif/;
    const extname = allowedTypes.test(
      path.extname(file.originalname).toLowerCase()
    );
    const mimetype = allowedTypes.test(file.mimetype);
    
    if (mimetype && extname) {
      return cb(null, true);
    } else {
      cb(new Error('Only image files are allowed'));
    }
  },
  limits: {
    fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 // 5MB limit
  }
});
```

## Data Protection

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Never commit secrets to version control
# Use .env files for development (add .env to .gitignore)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
API_KEY=your-external-api-key
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
```

### Database Security
```javascript
// Encrypt sensitive data at rest
const crypto = require('crypto');

const encrypt = (text) => {
  const algorithm = 'aes-256-cbc';
  const key = crypto.scryptSync(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY, 'salt', 32);
  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
  
  const cipher = crypto.createCipher(algorithm, key, iv);
  let encrypted = cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex');
  encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
  
  return {
    encrypted,
    iv: iv.toString('hex')
  };
};

// Regular database backups with encryption
// Implement proper access controls
// Use connection pooling with limits
```

### API Security
```javascript
// Rate limiting
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP'
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);

// CORS configuration
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}));

// Security headers
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());
```

## Logging & Monitoring

### Security Event Logging
```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const securityLogger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ 
      filename: 'logs/security.log',
      level: 'warn'
    }),
    new winston.transports.Console({
      format: winston.format.simple()
    })
  ]
});

// Log security events
const logSecurityEvent = (event, details) => {
  securityLogger.warn('Security Event', {
    event,
    details,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    ip: details.ip,
    userAgent: details.userAgent
  });
};

// Example usage
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  // ... authentication logic
  
  if (!validCredentials) {
    logSecurityEvent('Failed Login Attempt', {
      email: req.body.email,
      ip: req.ip,
      userAgent: req.get('User-Agent')
    });
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
  }
});
```

# Code Quality & Error Prevention Rules

## File Organization Standards

### File Size Limits
- **Maximum file size**: 500 lines
- **Ideal file size**: 200-300 lines
- **When to split**: If file exceeds 400 lines, plan refactoring
- **Split strategy**: By feature, responsibility, or logical grouping

### Directory Structure Patterns
```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/         # Shared across features
│   └── feature-name/   # Feature-specific components
├── services/           # Business logic and API calls
├── utils/              # Pure utility functions
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks (if applicable)
├── types/              # Type definitions
├── constants/          # Application constants
└── tests/              # Test files
```

### Naming Conventions
```javascript
// Files: kebab-case
user-profile-component.js
api-service-helper.js

// Variables and functions: camelCase
const userProfile = {};
function getUserById(id) {}

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';
const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;

// Classes: PascalCase
class UserProfileManager {}

// Components: PascalCase (React/Vue)
const UserProfile = () => {};
```

## Error Handling Standards

### Comprehensive Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
// Service layer error handling
class ApiService {
  async fetchUser(userId) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
      
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
      }
      
      const data = await response.json();
      return { success: true, data };
      
    } catch (error) {
      // Log error for debugging
      console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
      
      // Return structured error response
      return {
        success: false,
        error: {
          message: this.getErrorMessage(error),
          code: this.getErrorCode(error),
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
        }
      };
    }
  }
  
  getErrorMessage(error) {
    if (error.name === 'TypeError') {
      return 'Network connection failed';
    }
    if (error.message.includes('404')) {
      return 'User not found';
    }
    return 'An unexpected error occurred';
  }
  
  getErrorCode(error) {
    if (error.name === 'TypeError') return 'NETWORK_ERROR';
    if (error.message.includes('404')) return 'NOT_FOUND';
    return 'UNKNOWN_ERROR';
  }
}

// Component error handling
const UserProfile = ({ userId }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const loadUser = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      setError(null);
      
      const result = await apiService.fetchUser(userId);
      
      if (result.success) {
        setUser(result.data);
      } else {
        setError(result.error);
      }
      
      setLoading(false);
    };
    
    loadUser();
  }, [userId]);
  
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorDisplay error={error} />;
  if (!user) return <div>No user found</div>;
  
  return <div>{/* User profile content */}</div>;
};
```

### Error Logging Strategy
```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

// Configure logger
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.errors({ stack: true }),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'logs/error.log', level: 'error' }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'logs/combined.log' }),
    new winston.transports.Console({
      format: winston.format.simple()
    })
  ]
});

// Error logging helper
const logError = (error, context = {}) => {
  logger.error('Application Error', {
    message: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    context,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
};

// Usage in application
try {
  await processPayment(paymentData);
} catch (error) {
  logError(error, {
    operation: 'processPayment',
    userId: paymentData.userId,
    amount: paymentData.amount
  });
  throw new PaymentProcessingError('Payment failed');
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing Standards
```javascript
// Test file naming: [filename].test.js
// Example: user-service.test.js

describe('UserService', () => {
  let userService;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    userService = new UserService();
  });
  
  describe('getUserById', () => {
    it('should return user when ID exists', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '123';
      const expectedUser = { id: userId, name: 'John Doe' };
      
      // Mock external dependencies
      jest.spyOn(apiClient, 'get').mockResolvedValue(expectedUser);
      
      // Act
      const result = await userService.getUserById(userId);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result.success).toBe(true);
      expect(result.data).toEqual(expectedUser);
      expect(apiClient.get).toHaveBeenCalledWith(`/users/${userId}`);
    });
    
    it('should handle error when user not found', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = 'nonexistent';
      jest.spyOn(apiClient, 'get').mockRejectedValue(new Error('404'));
      
      // Act
      const result = await userService.getUserById(userId);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result.success).toBe(false);
      expect(result.error.code).toBe('NOT_FOUND');
    });
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing Patterns
```javascript
// Integration test example
describe('User API Integration', () => {
  let app;
  let testDb;
  
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Set up test database
    testDb = await setupTestDatabase();
    app = createApp(testDb);
  });
  
  afterAll(async () => {
    await cleanupTestDatabase(testDb);
  });
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await seedTestData(testDb);
  });
  
  it('should create and retrieve user', async () => {
    // Create user
    const newUser = { name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'jane@example.com' };
    const createResponse = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send(newUser)
      .expect(201);
    
    const userId = createResponse.body.id;
    
    // Retrieve user
    const getResponse = await request(app)
      .get(`/api/users/${userId}`)
      .expect(200);
    
    expect(getResponse.body.name).toBe(newUser.name);
    expect(getResponse.body.email).toBe(newUser.email);
  });
});
```

## Code Documentation Standards

### JSDoc Documentation
```javascript
/**
 * Processes a payment transaction
 * @param {Object} paymentData - Payment information

  return {
    end: () => {
      const duration = performance.now() - start;
      console.log(`${operationName} took ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);
      
      // Log slow operations
      if (duration > 1000) {
        logger.warn('Slow Operation', {
          operation: operationName,
          duration: duration,
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString()

# AI Collaboration Optimization Rules

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### Context-Rich Prompting Pattern
Always provide complete context when requesting AI assistance:

```
Context: [Current project state, relevant files, recent changes]
Goal: [What you want to achieve]
Constraints: [Any limitations, requirements, or standards to follow]
Expected Output: [Format and structure of desired response]
Success Criteria: [How to know if the solution is correct]
```

Example:
```
Context: Building a user authentication system for an e-commerce app. Using Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL. Already have user registration working.

Goal: Implement secure login functionality with JWT tokens and session management.

Constraints: 
- Must follow security-first principles from 03-security.md
- Sessions should expire after 24 hours
- Support both email and username login
- Rate limiting for failed attempts

Expected Output: Complete implementation with error handling, tests, and security considerations.

## Collaboration Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Ineffective Prompting
❌ **Avoid**: Vague requests without context
```
"Help me fix this bug"
```

✅ **Better**: Specific, contextual requests
```
Context: User authentication system, Node.js/Express
Problem: JWT tokens are being rejected after 30 minutes, but they should be valid for 24 hours
Current Implementation: [paste relevant code]
Expected Behavior: Tokens should remain valid for 24 hours
Error Message: "Token expired" appearing prematurely
```

### Context Loss Prevention
❌ **Avoid**: Starting sessions without context
❌ **Avoid**: Assuming AI remembers previous conversations
❌ **Avoid**: Working without documentation updates

✅ **Better**: Always start with context recap
✅ **Better**: Update project documentation consistently
✅ **Better**: Maintain decision logs and rationale

### Incomplete Specifications
❌ **Avoid**: Requests without success criteria
❌ **Avoid**: Missing constraint information
❌ **Avoid**: No consideration of edge cases

✅ **Better**: Complete problem specification
✅ **Better**: Clear success criteria and constraints
✅ **Better**: Explicit consideration of edge cases and error conditions
