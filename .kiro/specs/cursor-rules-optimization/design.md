# Design Document

## Document Information
- **Feature Name**: Cursor Rules Optimization
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-01-08
- **Author**: AI Assistant
- **Requirements Reference**: requirements.md

## Overview

This design outlines a systematic approach to analyze, consolidate, and optimize the existing 17 Cursor rule files into a more streamlined, effective system. The design focuses on eliminating redundancy while preserving valuable content and integrating Kiro taskmaster functionality.

### Design Goals
- Reduce the number of rule files from 17 to approximately 8-10 focused files
- Eliminate redundant content while preserving all valuable information
- Create a clear, logical organization that improves usability
- Integrate Kiro taskmaster methodology into the rule system
- Establish a framework for ongoing rule maintenance and improvement

### Key Decisions
- **Consolidation over Elimination**: Merge related content rather than delete valuable information
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Create core rules with specialized extensions
- **Traceability**: Maintain clear mapping from old to new structure
- **Incremental Implementation**: Design for phased rollout to minimize disruption

## Architecture

### System Overview
The optimization system consists of four main components:

1. **Analysis Engine**: Examines existing rules for content, structure, and redundancies
2. **Consolidation Planner**: Designs new file structure and content organization
3. **Content Merger**: Combines related content while eliminating redundancy
4. **Quality Validator**: Ensures no critical information is lost during optimization

### Component Relationships
```
Existing Rules (17 files) → Analysis Engine → Redundancy Report
                                ↓
Content Merger ← Consolidation Planner ← Analysis Results
     ↓
Optimized Rules (8-10 files) → Quality Validator → Final Validation
```
