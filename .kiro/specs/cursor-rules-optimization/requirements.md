## Introduction

This project aims to analyze, optimize, and consolidate the existing Cursor rules to eliminate redundancy, improve clarity, and enhance effectiveness while maintaining comprehensive coverage of development best practices.

### Feature Summary

### Business Value
- Reduced cognitive load for developers using the rules
- Improved consistency and clarity in development practices
- Better maintainability of the rule system
- Enhanced AI agent performance through clearer, more focused rules

### Scope
**Included:**
- Analysis of all 17 existing rule files
- Identification of redundant content and overlapping patterns
- Consolidation of related rules into fewer, more focused files
- Creation of a recommendations folder for improvements
- Integration of Kiro taskmaster functionality into rules

**Excluded:**
- Complete rewrite of all rules (preserve valuable content)
- Changes to the underlying Cursor IDE functionality
- Modification of external dependencies or tools

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Rule Analysis
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a thorough analysis of existing rules so that I can understand what content exists and where redundancies occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing the rule files THEN the system SHALL identify all 17 existing rule files and their purposes
2. WHEN examining content THEN the system SHALL map overlapping topics and redundant information across files
3. WHEN reviewing structure THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent formatting and organization patterns
4. IF redundant content is found THEN the system SHALL document specific examples and locations
5. WHILE analyzing THEN the system SHALL preserve a record of all original content for reference

### Requirement 2: Redundancy Identification and Documentation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of redundancies so that I can understand what needs to be consolidated.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN identifying redundancies THEN the system SHALL create a detailed report of overlapping content
2. WHEN documenting redundancies THEN the system SHALL specify which files contain duplicate information
3. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL identify repeated concepts across multiple files
4. IF similar content exists THEN the system SHALL recommend which version to keep as the canonical source
5. WHILE documenting THEN the system SHALL categorize redundancies by severity (high, medium, low impact)

### Requirement 3: Rule Consolidation Strategy
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear strategy for consolidating rules so that the final system is more manageable and effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating consolidation strategy THEN the system SHALL propose a new file structure with fewer, more focused files
2. WHEN consolidating content THEN the system SHALL preserve all valuable information while eliminating redundancy
3. WHEN organizing rules THEN the system SHALL group related concepts into logical, cohesive files
4. IF content can be merged THEN the system SHALL specify how to combine it effectively
5. WHILE consolidating THEN the system SHALL maintain traceability to original sources

### Requirement 4: Improvement Recommendations
**User Story:** As a developer, I want specific recommendations for improving the rule system so that I can make informed decisions about changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL create specific, actionable improvement suggestions
2. WHEN identifying issues THEN the system SHALL categorize them by priority and impact
3. WHEN suggesting changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear rationale for each recommendation
4. IF alternatives exist THEN the system SHALL present multiple options with trade-offs
5. WHILE recommending THEN the system SHALL consider maintainability and usability

### Requirement 5: Kiro Taskmaster Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro taskmaster functionality integrated into the rules so that AI agents can replicate its systematic approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN integrating taskmaster functionality THEN the system SHALL analyze Kiro's three-phase methodology (Requirements → Design → Tasks)
2. WHEN creating taskmaster rules THEN the system SHALL ensure AI agents can follow the systematic spec-driven approach
3. WHEN implementing workflow THEN the system SHALL include proper phase transitions and validation gates
4. IF taskmaster patterns exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into clear, actionable rules
5. WHILE integrating THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing Cursor IDE features

### Requirement 6: Task Complexity Analysis and Expansion
**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI agents to automatically analyze task complexity and expand complex tasks into manageable subtasks so that implementation is more systematic and manageable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN analyzing tasks THEN the system SHALL evaluate complexity using a 1-10 scoring system based on technical complexity, coordination needs, risk factors, and implementation scope
2. WHEN a task complexity score is ≥5 THEN the system SHALL automatically flag it for potential expansion into subtasks
3. WHEN expanding complex tasks THEN the system SHALL generate 3-8 subtasks with clear dependencies, acceptance criteria, and estimated effort
4. IF research mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL analyze existing codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools before task expansion
5. WHILE creating subtasks THEN the system SHALL ensure each subtask follows single responsibility principle and has testable boundaries

### Requirement 6: Quality Assurance and Validation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want assurance that the optimized rules maintain quality and effectiveness so that the system remains valuable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN optimizing rules THEN the system SHALL validate that no critical information is lost
2. WHEN consolidating content THEN the system SHALL ensure all important concepts are preserved
3. WHEN creating new structure THEN the system SHALL verify logical organization and flow
4. IF changes are made THEN the system SHALL provide before/after comparisons
5. WHILE optimizing THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve rule clarity and usability

### Requirement 7: Kiro Communication Style Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the optimized rules to capture Kiro's direct, action-oriented communication style so that AI agents replicate effective collaboration patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN defining communication patterns THEN the system SHALL capture the Listen → Understand → Act approach
2. WHEN documenting interaction style THEN the system SHALL emphasize direct execution over verbose explanation
3. WHEN specifying validation patterns THEN the system SHALL use strategic check-ins rather than excessive questioning
4. IF communication conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize Kiro's efficient style over verbose alternatives
5. WHILE integrating style THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency across all consolidated rules

### Requirement 8: Implementation Roadmap
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear roadmap for implementing the optimized rules so that I can execute the changes systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating roadmap THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step implementation instructions
