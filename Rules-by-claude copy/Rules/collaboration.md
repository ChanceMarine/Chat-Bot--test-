# AI Collaboration Optimization Rules

## Communication Integration

### Direct Action-Oriented Approach
Clyde's communication style emphasizes immediate action over lengthy discussion:

**Effective Pattern:**
```
User: "I need user authentication"
Clyde: [Creates comprehensive authentication design with security considerations]
Clyde: "This covers JWT tokens, session management, and security validation. Ready to implement?"
```

**Avoid:**
```
User: "I need user authentication"  
Clyde: "I'd be happy to help you with authentication! Let me break down what we need to consider:
1. First, we should think about authentication methods...
2. Then we need to consider security...
3. After that, we should plan the implementation...
Would you like me to start with requirements gathering?"
```

### Strategic Validation Points
- Validate at phase transitions (Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation)
- Use simple, direct questions: "Does this approach work for you?"
- Don't ask permission for obvious next steps
- Focus on forward momentum while ensuring alignment

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### Context-Rich Prompting Pattern
Always provide complete context when requesting AI assistance:

```
Context: [Current project state, relevant files, recent changes]
Goal: [What you want to achieve]
Constraints: [Any limitations, requirements, or standards to follow]
Expected Output: [Format and structure of desired response]
Success Criteria: [How to know if the solution is correct]
```

Example:
```
Context: Building a user authentication system for an e-commerce app. Using Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL. Already have user registration working.

Goal: Implement secure login functionality with JWT tokens and session management.

Constraints: 
- Must follow security-first principles from 03-security.md
- Sessions should expire after 24 hours
- Support both email and username login
- Rate limiting for failed attempts

Expected Output: Complete implementation with error handling, tests, and security considerations.

Success Criteria: User can login securely, invalid attempts are blocked, sessions are properly managed.
```

### Structured Request Templates

#### For Code Implementation
```
Role: Senior Developer
Task: [Specific implementation task]
Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

Architecture Context: [Relevant architectural decisions]
Security Considerations: [Any security implications]
Testing Requirements: [What needs to be tested]

Please provide:
1. Complete implementation
2. Error handling
3. Unit tests
4. Documentation
```

#### For Code Review
```
Role: QA Engineer
Task: Review this code for quality, security, and potential issues

Code: [Paste code here]

Focus Areas:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Error handling completeness
- Performance implications
- Code maintainability
- Test coverage gaps

Please provide:
1. Issues found with severity levels
2. Specific recommendations for improvements
3. Security concerns and mitigations
4. Testing suggestions
```

#### For Architecture Decisions
```
Role: Solutions Architect
Task: Evaluate architectural options for [specific problem]

Current Architecture: [Brief description]
Problem: [What needs to be solved]
Constraints: [Technical, budget, time constraints]

Options to Consider:
1. [Option 1 description]
2. [Option 2 description]  
3. [Option 3 description]

Please provide:
1. Analysis of each option with pros/cons
2. Recommendation with reasoning
3. Implementation considerations
4. Risk assessment
```

## Reasoning Framework Patterns

### Decision Tree Prompting
For complex decisions, guide AI through systematic analysis:

```
Analyze this decision using the following framework:

1. Problem Definition
   - What exactly are we trying to solve?
   - What are the success criteria?

2. Options Analysis
   - What are all viable options?
   - What are the trade-offs for each?

3. Constraint Evaluation  
   - What technical constraints apply?
   - What business constraints apply?
   - What resource constraints apply?

4. Risk Assessment
   - What could go wrong with each option?
   - How likely and severe are these risks?

5. Recommendation
   - Which option best meets our criteria?
   - What is the reasoning behind this choice?
   - What mitigations are needed?
```

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving
```
Break down this problem step by step:

1. Understanding: Explain what the problem is asking
2. Analysis: Identify the key components and relationships  
3. Approach: Describe your solution strategy
4. Implementation: Provide the detailed solution
5. Validation: How can we verify this works correctly?
6. Edge Cases: What unusual scenarios should we consider?
```

## Context Preservation Techniques

### Project State Documentation
Maintain these documents for AI context:

```markdown
# Project Context Summary

## Current Status
- Phase: [Requirements/Design/Implementation]
- Last Completed: [Recent milestone]
- Currently Working On: [Current tasks]
- Blocked By: [Any blockers or dependencies]

## Key Decisions Made
- [Decision 1]: [Brief rationale]
- [Decision 2]: [Brief rationale]
- [Decision 3]: [Brief rationale]

## Architecture Overview
- Tech Stack: [Technologies in use]
- Key Components: [Main system components]
- External Dependencies: [Third-party services/APIs]

## Current Priorities
1. [Priority item 1]
2. [Priority item 2]  
3. [Priority item 3]

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- [Issue 1]: [Impact and potential solution]
- [Issue 2]: [Impact and potential solution]
```

### Session Continuity Pattern
Start each AI interaction with context recap:

```
Session Context:
- Previous work: [What was accomplished last session]
- Current goal: [What we're working on now]
- Relevant files: [Files that may be referenced]
- Dependencies: [What this work depends on]
- Next steps: [Planned progression]
```

## Delegation and Subtask Management

### Task Decomposition Framework
When facing complex tasks, use this breakdown pattern:

```
Complex Task: [Main task description]

Subtask Analysis:
1. [Subtask 1]
   - Complexity: [1-5 scale]
   - Dependencies: [What must be done first]
   - Persona: [Which expert perspective needed]
   - Estimated Effort: [Time/complexity estimate]

2. [Subtask 2]
   - Complexity: [1-5 scale]
   - Dependencies: [What must be done first]  
   - Persona: [Which expert perspective needed]
   - Estimated Effort: [Time/complexity estimate]

Implementation Sequence:
1. [Order of execution with rationale]
2. [Parallel vs sequential considerations]
3. [Integration points and dependencies]

Risk Assessment:
- [Potential issues and mitigation strategies]
```

### Multi-Perspective Analysis
For architectural or design decisions, get multiple viewpoints:

```
Analyze this from multiple perspectives:

Business Analyst View:
- How does this serve business objectives?
- What are the user experience implications?
- What are the cost/benefit considerations?

Technical Architect View:
- How does this fit with existing architecture?
- What are the scalability implications?
- What technical risks should we consider?

Security Engineer View:
- What security implications exist?
- How do we mitigate potential vulnerabilities?
- What compliance requirements apply?

DevOps Engineer View:
- How complex is deployment and maintenance?
- What monitoring and observability is needed?
- How does this affect system reliability?
```

## Research Integration Patterns

### Technology Research Template
```

Analysis Framework:
1. Approach: How do they solve this problem?
2. Architecture: What technical approach do they use?

## Collaboration Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Ineffective Prompting
❌ **Avoid**: Vague requests without context
```
"Help me fix this bug"
```

✅ **Better**: Specific, contextual requests
```
Context: User authentication system, Node.js/Express
Problem: JWT tokens are being rejected after 30 minutes, but they should be valid for 24 hours
Current Implementation: [paste relevant code]
Expected Behavior: Tokens should remain valid for 24 hours
Error Message: "Token expired" appearing prematurely
```

### Context Loss Prevention
❌ **Avoid**: Starting sessions without context
❌ **Avoid**: Assuming AI remembers previous conversations
❌ **Avoid**: Working without documentation updates

✅ **Better**: Always start with context recap
✅ **Better**: Update project documentation consistently
✅ **Better**: Maintain decision logs and rationale

### Incomplete Specifications
❌ **Avoid**: Requests without success criteria
❌ **Avoid**: Missing constraint information
❌ **Avoid**: No consideration of edge cases

✅ **Better**: Complete problem specification
✅ **Better**: Clear success criteria and constraints
✅ **Better**: Explicit consideration of edge cases and error conditions
