# Changes Needed for TaskMaster Integration

## ✅ **Completed Changes**

### 1. **Main Configuration (.cursorrules)**
- ✅ **Updated**: Complete rewrite for TaskMaster integration
- ✅ **New Focus**: PRD creation → TaskMaster coordination → Quality assurance
- ✅ **Role Definition**: Strategic director working with TaskMaster

### 2. **Methodology (Rules/methodology.md)**
- ✅ **Updated**: First two phases rewritten for TaskMaster integration
- ✅ **New Workflow**: PRD → TaskMaster Coordination → Quality Assurance
- ⚠️ **Needs**: Phase 3 section still has old task format (can be ignored since TaskMaster handles this)

### 3. **Business Analyst (Agents/02-business-analyst.md)**
- ✅ **Updated**: PRD template structure added
- ⚠️ **Needs**: Full rewrite to focus on comprehensive PRD creation

## 🔄 **Remaining Changes Needed**

### **High Priority:**

1. **Business Analyst Agent** - Focus on PRD creation instead of basic requirements
2. **Templates File** - Add comprehensive PRD templates
3. **README.md** - Update to reflect TaskMaster integration

### **Medium Priority:**

4. **Solutions Architect Agent** - Update to focus on architectural guidance during TaskMaster execution
5. **Senior Developer Agent** - Update to focus on code quality oversight
6. **QA Engineer Agent** - Update to focus on quality assurance oversight

### **Low Priority:**

7. **Collaboration Rules** - Update for TaskMaster coordination patterns
8. **System Summary** - Update to reflect new workflow

## 🎯 **What TaskMaster Handles (We Don't Need)**

### **TaskMaster's Responsibilities:**
- ✅ **Task Breakdown**: Detailed task creation and sequencing
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Task status and completion monitoring  
- ✅ **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Code generation and file management
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Directory and file organization
- ✅ **ASCII Tables**: Task visualization and tracking

### **Our Responsibilities:**
- 🎯 **PRD Creation**: Comprehensive product requirements
- 🏗️ **Architectural Guidance**: High-level design decisions
- 🔒 **Security Oversight**: Ensure security best practices
- 🔍 **Quality Assurance**: Code quality and testing standards
- 📋 **Expert Consultation**: Specialized knowledge when needed

## 📋 **Key Integration Points**

### **Handoff to TaskMaster:**
```
User: [Describes what they want to build]
Clyde: [Creates comprehensive PRD]
User: [Approves PRD]
Clyde: "Perfect! I'll now coordinate with TaskMaster to break this down into implementable tasks and guide you through the development process."
```

### **During TaskMaster Execution:**
- Clyde provides architectural guidance when TaskMaster needs expert input
- Clyde monitors security implementation and code quality
- Clyde validates that acceptance criteria are being met
- Clyde ensures comprehensive testing is included

### **Quality Gates:**
- Security review at key implementation points
- Code quality validation throughout development
- Testing coverage verification
- Performance requirements validation

## 🚀 **System Status**

**Ready for Testing**: The core integration is complete. TaskMaster can now handle the detailed implementation while Clyde provides strategic oversight and quality assurance.

**Optional Improvements**: The remaining changes would enhance the experience but aren't required for basic functionality.

**Key Benefit**: Users get the best of both worlds - TaskMaster's execution capabilities combined with Clyde's strategic guidance and quality oversight! 🎯
